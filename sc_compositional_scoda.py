# Compositional analysis can be done on the level of cell identity clusters in
# the form of known cell types or cell states corresponding to, for example, 
# cells recently affected by perturbations.
# This chapter will introduce both approaches and apply them to the Haber
# dataset[Haber et al., 2017]. This dataset contains 53,193 individual 
# epithelial cells from the small intestine and organoids of mice.

# We will use scCODA
# As a first step, we instantiate a scCODA model.

# Then, we use load function to prepare a MuData object for subsequent processing, 
# and it creates a compositional analysis dataset from the input adata. And we 
# specify the cell_type_identifier as cell_label, sample_identifier as batch, 
# and covariate_obs as condition in our case.

# which is a cell type that has nearly constant relative abundance over all 
# samples, or be run with a user specified reference cell type.

# 0.4 and 0.9. Acceptance rates that are way higher or too low indicate issues with
# the sampling process.

# The desired FDR level can be easily set after inference via sim_results.set_fdr().
# Per default, the value is 0.05. Since, depending on the dataset, the FDR can have

# to get the most prominent effects.
